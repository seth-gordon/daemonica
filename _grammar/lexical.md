### Organic/mechanical polysemy

In many languages, terms for organic
matter are used as metaphors for artifacts, or vice versa:
consider how a spy satellite may be called an “eye in the sky,”
or how the human circulatory system involves a “bloodstream.” In
Daemonica, this kind of usage is so pervasive that it hardly
deserves to be called metaphorical. When there is a risk of
confusion, there are prefixes to help disambiguate the possible
meanings.

>- Kāhmvu pi gu.
>- leg D2\1SG ABS
>- I have legs.

>- Ŋha-kāhmvu pi gu.
>- MECH-leg D2\1SG ABS
>- I have a drive shaft.

>- Bntar-kāhmvu pi šar-gu knbar-kāhmvi pe gi
  dzu.
>- ORG-leg D2\1SG NEG-ABS D2\PROS-leg
  D3\1SG D2\ABS and
>- I don’t have legs, but I have a wheelchair.

The person saying _Ŋha-kāhmvu pi smdur_ might be an auto mechanic,
or they might be using _ŋhakāhmvu_ as synecdoche for a
car, in the way an English speaker might say “wheels.”

### Hypernymy, co-hyponymy, metonymy

The suffix _vu_ derives a hypernym of the word it is
attached to.

>- Tatorhu-vu pi abū.
>- bear-hypernym D2\1SG chase
>- A carnivore chased me.

>- Tatorhu pi-vi abū.
>- bear D2\1SG-hypernym chase
>- Bears chase my people.

>- Pu taterhi abū-vu.
>- 1SG D2\bear chase-hypernym
>- I am interested in bears.

The prefix _þr_ translates a word to a related and
broader term, usually by metonymy.

>- Þr-ðu-kur pi abū.
>- LIKE-four-NMLZ D2\1SG chase
>- A land animal (tetrapod) chased me.

>- Pu þr-kši abū.
>- 1SG D2\LIKE-star chase
>- I pursue goals.

The prefix _mzā_ could be thought of as the inverse of
_þr_: it translates a stem to a metonymically
_narrower_ meaning. Usually, this is a proper noun.

>- Mzā-tatorhu pi abū.
>- PN-bear D2\1SG chase
>- Bear (i.e., a person named Bear) chased me.

In some cases, replacing long vowels with their short
counterparts and vice versa (except for short vowels followed by
‹r›) transforms a
word into a closely
related one, a co-hyponym.

>- Tātorhū pi abū.
>- panda D2\1SG chase
>- A panda chased me.

### Colors

Daemonica has three basic color words: _mhu_ (black),
_þpardū_ (white, gray, bright yellow, or pale blue), and
_barhŋtu_ (orange or any shade of red). All other color terms
must be derived.

|                                                         |                   |                 |

| <span title="teal" style="color: teal">█</span>         | _tsarvobor:dwpfu_ | hot silver-like |


### Ethnic and sexual language

Daemonica has no simple and direct terms for categories of
sex, gender,
sexuality, or ethnicity. Instead, speakers either resort to
euphemisms (which very widely by region and age cohort), or they
use words that denote finer-grained concepts.

For example, suppose someone of a certain gender and ethnicity
was fired from her job in a discriminatory fashion. She might
phrase her ex-employer’s motivation in any of the following ways:

>- Pu rta-ðr-tŋtši-di[^1] mzür-türtsē
  mzar-fnha-batŋdi-hnži dur.
>- 1SG D2\DUP-LIKE-nest-APPL
  D3\SWAP-boss D2\SWAP-ANTI-tie-PFV make
>- I was fired because I am a woman (lit.,
  because I belong to the child-nurturing class).

>- Pu rta-ðr-tažir-di[^2] mzür-türtsē
  mzar-fnha-batŋdi-hnži dur.
>- 1SG D2\DUP-LIKE-eye-APPL
  D3\SWAP-boss D2\SWAP-ANTI-tie-PFV make
>- I was fired because I am a woman (lit., because I belong to
  the class of people who are judged by their
  appearance).

>- Pu rta-žar-ðr-bnhir-di[^3] mzür-türtsē
  mzar-fnha-batŋdi-hnži dur.
>- FSG D2\DUP-NEG-LIKE-hit-APPL
  D3\SWAP-boss D2\SWAP-ANTI-tie-PFV make
>- I was fired because I am not a man (lit., because I do not
  belong to the warrior class).

>- Pu rta-ðr-žar-tsir-di[^4]
  mzür-türtsē mzar-fnha-batŋdi-hnži dur.
>- 1SG D2\DUP-LIKE-NEG-earth-APPL
  D3\SWAP-boss D2\SWAP-ANTI-tie-PFV make
>- I was fired because I belong to a landless ethnic
   group.

>- Pu þaðēhi-di mta-dzī mzür-türtsē
  mzar-fnha-batŋdi-hnži dur.
>- 1SG D2\four:two:one-NMLZ D2\OVER-friend
  D3\SWAP-boss D2\SWAP-ANTI-tie-PFV make
>- I was fired because I am a friend of <q>44.</q>

As an aside, let us observe how the stack changes with each word of
a sentence like this. In the translations, separate items on the
stack are divided by slashes, with the topmost on the
right.

<dl>
  <dt>Pu</dt> <dd>Me</dd>
  <dt>Pu rta…</dt> <dd>Me / me…</dd>
  <dt>Pu rtaðrtŋtšidi</dt> <dd>Me / I am a woman</dd>
  <dt>Pu rtaðrtŋtšidi mzür…</dt> <dd>I am a woman / me / …</dd>
  <dt>Pu rtaðrtŋtšidi mzürtũrtsē</dt> <dd>I am a woman / me / boss</dd>
  <dt>Pu rtaðrtŋtšidi mzürtũrtsē mzar…</dt> <dd>I am a woman / boss /
  me / …</dd>
  <dt>Pu rtaðrtŋtšidi mzürkše mzarfnhabatŋdihnži</dt>
    <dd>I am a woman / I was fired</dd>
  <dt>Pu rtaðrtŋtšidi mzürkše mzarfnhabatŋdihnži dur</dt>
    <dd>I was fired because I am a woman.</dd>

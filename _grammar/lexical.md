### Numbers and other forms of quantification

|       ½ | _du_   |      2π | _wðu_            |

A Daemonica number is formed by a numeric prefix and
either a numeric constant, or a sequence of digits.
Repeated digits, such as _kaku_ (5, 5) are interpreted
as reciprocals. The integers in the digit-representation
are summed; the reciprocals are multiplied; and then the
sum is multiplied by the reciprocals to form the actual
number.

>- tr-pay-to-ko-ko-þu
>- numeric.0-one.third-three-five-five-eight
>- eleven fifteenths ((3 + 8) / (3 × 5))

Numeric constants are not treated as digits.

>- tr-vazmfu
>- numeric.0-fifty.five
>- fifty-five

>- *tr-vazmfo-þtu
>- numeric.0-fifty.five-thirty.four
>- eighty-nine

A nullary number is simply an abstract value; a unary number
is multiplied by its absolutive argument; a binary number is
multiplied by its absolutive argument and then added to its
ergative argument.

>- tr-vazmfu pa-bu
>- numeric.0-fifty.five numeric.1-two
>- one hundred and ten

>- tr-vazmfu tr-vu pw-þtu
>- numeric.0-fifty.five numeric.0-one numeric.2-thirty-four
>- eighty-nine

Other words can take numeric prefixes as well. The most common
reason for doing this is to form units of measure.

>- dažŋģū pa-džur
>- fish numeric.1-pot
>- a pot of fish

>- tatorhu tr-zir pw-ðu
>- bear D2\numeric.0-rock numeric.2-eight
>- a bear that weighs about 375 kg (eight ‘rocks’)

### Colors

Daemonica has three basic color words: _þduy_ (black),
_þayžgu_ (white, gray, bright yellow, or pale blue), and
_gvu_ (orange or any shade of red). All other color terms
are derived, often using the prefix _þay-_, which can derive
a unary word for any sensory characteristic.

### Ethnic and sexual language

Terms related to sex, gender, sexuality, and
ethnicity cannot be translated precisely into Daemonica—or, rather,
the closest corresponding terms are _too_ precise. Sometimes,
speakers resort to euphemisms to hint at a culturally-specific category.

>- Ša-vbū þi bā-vparpuy-kū þi bva-ša-dðiy pfm.
>- raise.ERG-lead D2\1.EXCL want-independent-INCOH D2\1.EXCL D2\REFL-raise.ERG-young imply
>- The boss wants to fire me because I’m a woman
   (because I should be taking care of children).

>- Ša-vbū þi bā-vparpuy-kū þi bva-da-vbē:bī pfm.
>- raise.ERG-lead D2\1.EXCL want-independent-INCOH D2\1.EXCL D2\REFL-raise.ABS-ruling.class imply
>- The boss wants to fire me because I’m a woman
   (because I should not be in a position of authority).

>- Ša-vbū þi bā-vparpuy-kū þi sũ-že fī pfm.
>- raise.ERG-lead D2\1.EXCL want-independent-INCOH
   D2\1.EXCL D3\raise.LOC-nothing D2\ERG imply
>- The boss wants to fire me because I belong to a landless ethnic group.

>- Ša-vbū þi bā-vparpuy-kū þi tr-ðtü-ðæ-ti ķgir pfm.
>- raise.ERG-lead D2\1.EXCL want-independent-INCOH
   D2\1.EXCL D3\numeric.2-thirty.four-eight-three D2\friend imply
>- The boss wants to fire me because I’m a friend of ‘45.’

Consisently using the same word to translate one of these terms,
instead of choosing the right synonym for the context, is one of the
surest marks of a non-fluent Daemonica speaker.

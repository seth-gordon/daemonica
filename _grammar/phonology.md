### Alphabet

We will describe and use, in this
grammar, a romanization for Daemonica, although since
the language is historically more often spoken than written,
there is no true standard orthography. This system has the
following letters:

> a ā æ ã b d ð e ē f g ģ h i ī j k ķ m n ŋ o ō p r s š t þ u ū ü
  ũ v w x y z ž

The following consonants have pronounciations different from
their IPA values, or from typical English spelling:

- **ð** as in **th**is
- **g** always hard, as in **g**oose
- **ģ** /ɣ/ the voiced version of **ķ** below, as in the
    Arabic letter **gh**ayn
- **ķ** /x/ the unvoiced velar fricative, as in the
    German i**ch** and Scottish
    lo**ch**
- **ŋ** as in si**ng**
- **r** /ɹ/ as in **r**un
- **š** /ʃ/ as in **sh**eep
- **þ** /θ/ as in **th**ink
- **y** /j/ as in **y**es
- **ž** /ʒ/ as in mea**s**ure

The fricative pairs ‹f/v›, ‹ķ/ģ›, ‹s/z›, and ‹š/ž> are each two
allophones of the same phoneme; the voiced allophone only appears
when it is between two other voiced phonemes (/ɑhnbsu/ →
[ˈɑhn̩bzu] ‹ahnbzu› “flee”).

Vowels ‹e›, ‹o›,
and ‹u› are pronounced according to their IPA values
(approximately as in
m**ay**, g**o**,
b**oo**t); ‹a› is
generally pronounced /ɑ/ as in h**o**t; ‹æ› is
generally /ɛ/ as in
b**e**d; ‹ü› is generally /y/ as in German
**ü**ber or French t**u**.

Vowels may be either long or short, and the distinction is
phonemic, as in Finnish. In the alphabet above, a vowel with a
macron or tilde is the long version of the letter preceding it.
(Contrast
_tatorhu u_, “one bear,” with _tatorhu ū_, “this
bear.”)

### Phonology

For IPA purists, these tables show the phonemes and allophones:

#### Consonants

|-------------|--------|------------------|---------------|---------|---------|
| nasal       | m      | n                |               | ŋ       |         |
| plosive     | p, b   | t, d             |               | k, g    |         |
| sibilant    |        | s [z]            | ʃ [ʒ]         |         |         |     |
| fricative   | f [v]  | θ [ð]            |               | x [ɣ~ʁ] | h       |
| approximant | w      | ɹ                |               | j       |         |

#### Vowels

|           | front | near-front | back  |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------|
| close     | i, iː | y, yː      | u, uː |
| close-mid | e, eː |            | o, oː |
| open-mid  | ɛ, ɛː |            |       |
| open      |       |            | ɑ, ɑː |


### Vowel alternation rules

As mentioned above, Daemonica uses vowel alternation to indicate
the depth of the stack. The depth can only be presumed to be zero
at the very beginning of an utterance, and therefore, the zero
depth does not need to be represented by an inflection. The level-1
inflection is always used as a word’s citation form.

Using _tatorhu_ as our paradigm, the complete list of possible
inflections is:

|       |             |     |           |      |           |
|------:|-------------|----:|-----------|-----:|-----------|
| **1** | **tatorhu** | _8_ | _tutarho_ | _15_ | _toturha_ |
|     2 | taterhi     |   9 | titarhe   |   16 | tetirha   |
|     3 | tütærhe     |  10 | tetürhæ   |   17 | tæterhü   |
|     4 | tütorhu     |  11 | tutürho   |   18 | toturhü   |
|     5 | titarho     |  12 | totirha   |   19 | tatorhi   |
|     6 | titærhe     |  13 | tetirhæ   |   20 | tæterhi   |
|     7 | tutürhæ     |  14 | tæturhü   |   21 | tütærhu   |

Note that after seven levels, the same vowels are reused,
but in rotated positions.

A one-vowel word stem uses the same vowel as the final
syllable of a polysyllabic word (_ū_); a two-vowel stem
uses the first and last vowels of the paradigm (_abū_).
In stems with more than three syllables,
the middle vowel of the paradigm is repeated
(_tatorhoþpordū_, “polar bear”).

Prefixes use the first vowel of the paradigm (_fatatorhu_,
“something bear-like”); suffixes use the last
(_tatorhuzur_, “bear’s rear end”[^1]).

[^1]:
    In the lexicon, the “bottom side” suffix is listed under
    _sur_; it becomes _zur_ due to the voicing assimilation
    described above.

Because many phoneme combinations
can never appear in the same word (_taterhu_ is invalid),
and because every
speaker of
Daemonica is also natively fluent in a different language, there
may be considerable variation in how each vowel
phoneme is realized. A native speaker of American English, for
example, might realize both /o/ and /e/ as
[ə], while a Briton might realize /e/ as [ɛ̝] and /ɛ/ as [æ].

### Phonotactics

The nucleus of a Daemonica syllable is one of the
semivowels (/m/, /n/, /ŋ/, /w/, /ɹ/, or /j/), a vowel, or a
short vowel followed by /ɹ/.
The onset may be a non-glottal fricative
(/s/, /ʃ/, /f/, /θ/, or /x/), a plosive, or both, in either
order. If both of these are omitted, /h/ is inserted—except at
the beginning of a word: for instance, if the stack-duplicating
prefix _rta_ is inserted before _abū_, “chase,” it
becomes _rtahabū_, “chasing oneself.”

Note that, for example, _mpšu,_ “bird, airplane,”
is pronounced [m̩pʃu], not [m͡pʃu] or [məpʃu]:
the /m/ is treated as a syllable unto itself.

Stress falls on the first vowel of the stem, so
_tatorhu_ is pronounced [tˈɑtoɹhu], but _rtahabū_
is pronounced [ɹ̩tɑhˈɑbuː]. In a longer stem formed as a compound
of multiple roots, there may be secondary stress on the first
vowel of the other roots, so _tatorhoþpordū_
is pronounced [tˈɑtoɹhoθpˌoɹduː].

A vowel followed by /ɹ/ in a non-accented syllable may be realized
as the r-colored variant of the vowel instead of as two phones:
thus, _tatorhu_ may also be [tˈɑto˞hu].

### Alphabet

We will describe and use, in this
grammar, a romanization for Daemonica, although since
the language is historically more often spoken than written,
there is no true standard orthography. This system has the
following letters:

> a ā æ ã b d ð e ē f g ģ h i ī j k ķ m n ŋ o ō p r s š t þ u ū ü
  ũ v w x y z ž

The following consonants have pronounciations different from
their IPA values, or from typical English spelling:

- **ð** as in **th**is
- **g** always hard, as in **g**oose
- **ģ** /ɣ/ the voiced version of **ķ** below, as in the
    Arabic letter **gh**ayn
- **ķ** /x/ the unvoiced velar fricative, as in the
    German i**ch** and Scottish
    lo**ch**
- **ŋ** as in si**ng**
- **r** /ɹ/ as in **r**un
- **š** /ʃ/ as in **sh**eep
- **þ** /θ/ as in **th**ink
- **y** /j/ as in **y**es
- **ž** /ʒ/ as in mea**s**ure

The fricative pairs ‹f/v›, ‹ķ/ģ›, ‹s/z›, and ‹š/ž> are each two
allophones of the same phoneme; the voiced allophone only appears
when it is between two other voiced phonemes (/ɑrθuː/ →
[ˈɑrðuː] ‹arðū› “or”).

Vowels ‹e›, ‹o›,
and ‹u› are pronounced according to their IPA values
(approximately as in
m**ay**, g**o**,
b**oo**t); ‹a› is
generally pronounced /ɑ/ as in h**o**t; ‹æ› is
generally /ɛ/ as in
b**e**d; ‹ü› is generally /y/ as in German
**ü**ber or French t**u**.

Vowels may be either long or short, and the distinction is
phonemic, as in Finnish. In the alphabet above, a vowel with a
macron or tilde is the long version of the letter preceding it.
(Contrast
_tatorhu faharpu_, “angry bear,” with _tatorhu faharpū_, “curious
bear.”)

### Phonology

For IPA purists, these tables show the phonemes and allophones:

#### Vowels

|           | front | near-front | back  |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------|
| close     | i, iː | y, yː      | u, uː |
| close-mid | e, eː |            | o, oː |
| open-mid  | ɛ, ɛː |            |       |
| open      |       |            | ɑ, ɑː |


### Vowel alternation rules

As mentioned above, Daemonica uses vowel alternation to indicate
the depth of the stack. The depth can only be presumed to be zero
at the very beginning of an utterance, and therefore, the zero
depth does not need to be represented by an inflection. The level-1
inflection is always used as a word’s citation form.

Using _tatorhu_ as our paradigm, the complete list of possible
inflections is:

|       |             |     |           |      |           |
|------:|-------------|----:|-----------|-----:|-----------|
| **1** | **tatorhu** | _8_ | _tutarho_ | _15_ | _toturha_ |
|     2 | taterhi     |   9 | titarhe   |   16 | tetirha   |
|     3 | tütærhe     |  10 | tetürhæ   |   17 | tæterhü   |
|     4 | tütorhu     |  11 | tutürho   |   18 | toturhü   |
|     5 | titarho     |  12 | totirha   |   19 | tatorhi   |
|     6 | titærhe     |  13 | tetirhæ   |   20 | tæterhi   |
|     7 | tutürhæ     |  14 | tæturhü   |   21 | tütærhu   |

Note that after seven levels, the same vowels are reused,
but in rotated positions.

A one-vowel word stem uses the same vowel as the final
syllable of a polysyllabic word (_tū,_ “us”); a two-vowel stem
uses the first and last vowels of the paradigm (_fabur,_ “chase”).
In stems with more than three vowels,
the middle vowel of the paradigm is repeated
(_tatorhohŋhu_, “teddy bear”). Syllables containing semivowels are
ignored by the alternation rules.

Prefixes use the first vowel of the paradigm (_bvatatorhu_,
“is a bear”); suffixes use the last
(_tatorhuvu_, “one bear”[^1]).

[^1]:
    In the lexicon, the “singular” suffix is listed under
    _-fu_; it becomes _-vu_ due to the voicing assimilation
    described above.

Because many phoneme combinations
can never appear in the same word (_taterhu_ is invalid),
and because every
speaker of
Daemonica is also natively fluent in a different language, there
may be considerable variation in how each vowel
phoneme is realized. A native speaker of American English, for
example, might realize both /o/ and /e/ as
[ə], while a Briton might realize /e/ as [ɛ̝] and /ɛ/ as [æ].

### Phonotactics

The nucleus of a Daemonica syllable is one of the
semivowels (/m/, /n/, /ŋ/, /w/, /ɹ/, or /j/), a short vowel,
a long vowel, a short vowel followed by /ɹ/, or a short vowel
followed by /j/.
The onset may be a non-glottal fricative
(/s/, /ʃ/, /f/, /θ/, or /x/), a plosive, or both, in either
order. If both of these are omitted, /h/ is inserted—except at
the beginning of a word: for instance, _aybur_ is the word for
“or” in the sense of “I can outrun the bear _or_ outrun you,”
but its nominalized form, meaning “choice,” is _sbahaybur._

Note that, for example, _pfur,_ “see,” is pronounced
[pf͡uɹ], not [pə.fuɹ], and _džardrdžur,_ “oven,”
is pronounced [dʒ͡ɑɹ.dɹ̩.dʒ͡uɹ], not [dʒ͡ɑɹd.əɹ.dʒ͡uɹ].

Stress falls on the first vowel of the stem, so
_tatorhu_ is pronounced [ˈtɑ.toɹ.hu], but _bvatatorhu_
is pronounced [bv͡ɑˈtɑ.toɹ.hu]. In a stem formed as a compound
of multiple roots or by duplication of a syllable,
there may be secondary stress on the first
vowel of the other roots, or on the duplicated syllable:
_tatorhozpuvu,_ “one polar bear,” is pronounced [ˈtɑ.toɹ.hoˌzpu.vu],
and _tatorhohŋhu,_ “teddy bear,” is [ˈtɑ.toɹˌho.hŋ.hu].

A vowel followed by /ɹ/ in a non-accented syllable may be realized
as the r-colored variant of the vowel instead of as two phones:
thus, _tatorhu_ may also be [ˈtɑ.to˞.hu].

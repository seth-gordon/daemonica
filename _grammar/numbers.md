### Digits and their combination

#### Table of digit morphemes

|------:|---------|----:|---------|----:|----------|
| **0** | **šur** |  10 | _nhu_   |  20 | _dŋtu_   |

#### Bases

Daemonica uses a mixed-radix number system. A simple numeral
is a series of digit morphemes, arranged in order, with the
least significant digit first. All digits from the third onward
are in base-thirty (that is, _šaržorhu,_ zero:zero:one,
equals thirty). The value of the lower two digits goes
according to the following table:

|     |          |     |          |     |          |
|----:|----------|----:|----------|----:|----------|
|   0 | _šur_    |  10 | _šar:ðū_ |  20 | _šar:ðu_ |
|   1 | _u_      |  11 | _a:ðū_   |  21 | _a:ðu_   |
|   2 | _þū_     |  12 | _þā:ðū_  |  22 | _þā:ðu_  |
|   3 | _šu_     |  13 | _ša:ðū_  |  23 | _ša:ðu_  |
|   4 | _þu_     |  14 | _þu:ðū_  |  24 | _þu:ðu_  |
|   5 | _šar:hu_ |  15 | _šar:žu_ |  25 | _šur:zr_ |
|   6 | _a:hu_   |  16 | _a:žu_   |  26 | _u:zr_   |
|   7 | _þā:hu_  |  17 | _þā:žu_  |  27 | _þū:zr_  |
|   8 | _šu:hu_  |  18 | _šu:žu_  |  28 | _šu:zr_  |
|   9 | _þu:hu_  |  19 | _þu:žu_  |  29 | _þu:zr_  |

Thus, for instance:

>- Tatorhu šu.
>- bear three
>- There are three bears.

>- Tatorhu þuzr.
>- bear four:five
>- There are twenty-nine (4 + 4×5) bears.

>- Tatorhu ažorvu.
>- bear one:zero:six
>- There are one hundred and eighty-one (1 + 0×5 + 6×30) bears.

>- Tatorhu ažodŋtu.
>- bear one:three:twenty
>- There are six hundred and sixteen (1 + 3×5 + 20×30) bears.

>- Tatorhu šaržoržoržorhu.
>- bear zero:zero:zero:zero:one
>- There are 27,000 (30³) bears.

A word that does _not_ begin with the morphemes
_šur, u, þū,_ or _šu_ cannot be a number. Therefore,
the morphemes for the other twenty-six digits, when
appearing by themselves, as prefixes, or as suffixes,
may have non-numeric meanings (if they are not simply
nonsense syllables). “One bear” can be translated as
_tatorhu u,_ _tahorhuhu,_ or _atatorhu_: contrast with:

|                      |                      |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| _tatorhu šar:žor:vu_ | 180 (6×30) bears     |
| _tatorhu fu_         | the inside of a bear |
| _tatorhu-vu_         | carnivore            |
| _fa-tatorhu_         | something bear-ish   |


### Derived forms; addition; multiplication


An unmarked number is valence-1.
Its absolutive argument is the number of things counted;
if that argument is another number, it denotes multiplication.

|                 |                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| _šu-kur_        | three                 |
| _tatorhu šu_    | three bears           |
| _šu-kur þū_     | two times three       |
| _tatorhu šu þū_ | two-times-three bears |

The ergative argument of a number has two idiomatic usages.
If it is another number, it denotes addition. If the
absolutive argument is a
unit of measure, then the ergative argument is the thing
being measured and the number itself denotes the number of units.

|                           |                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| _ahntur taterhi šu-du_    | a person made a pair of bears        |
| _þu-kur taterhi šu-du_    | two-plus-three bears                 |
| _u-kur þi-kir šu-du_      | two times three, plus one            | 
| _tatorhu artrhir a:hu-du_ | a bear weighing 280 kg (six “rocks”) |


The diminutive prefix _sā_ creates a reciprocal, except
in the ergative position, where it negates.

|                          |                     |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| _šu-kur sā-ðu_           | two thirds          |
| _šu-kur sā-ði-kir smdur  | two minus three     |
| _šur-kur sā-ði-kir smdur | negative three      |
| _tatorhu sā-žur_         | too damn many bears | 


### Numeric prefixes and suffixes

The numeric morphemes _šur, hu, þū, šu_ can also appear as
prefixes or suffixes (with appropriate morphophonemic
modification). As suffixes, they denote their exact value. As
prefixes, they denote, respectively, negation, singular, plural,
and the associative plural (“X and company”). Recall that
prefixes are applied to a stem before suffixes.

>- Šar-tatorhu-hu pi abū.
>- NEG-bear-one D2\1SG chase
>- One non-bear chased me.

>- A-tatorhu-žar pi abū.
>- one-bear-NEG D2\1SG chase
>- Something other than a single bear chased me.

>- Tatorhu ša-pi abū.
>- bear D2\ASSOC-1SG chase
>- A bear chased me and my family.

>- Tatorhu pi ša-habū.
>- bear D2\1SG ASSOC-chase
>- A bear chased me, and did other things related to chasing.

### Pseudo-digits

Certain morphemes function as _pseudo-digits_: they must
follow at least one actual digit, and they either qualify the
number they are attached to (by changing its dimensionality, or
by converting it from a point into a range), or they express an
informal quantity.

A digit that may be used as a suffix may also be followed by a
pseudo-digit, as another suffix.

>- Tatorhu tatŋði šar:žor:ðō:tndu gu.
>- bear D2\fish D2\zero:zero:two:more.than ABS
>- A bear has over sixty fish.

>- Tatorhu tatŋði-hi:tsmdi gu.
>- bear D2\fish-one:enough ABS
>- A bear has enough fish.

>- Tatorhu tatŋði-ðī:tsmdi gu.
>- bear D2\fish-two:enough ABS
>- A bear has too much fish.

The pseudo-digits _mhur_ and _dntur_
change the dimension of a number.

>- Tatorhu þī-kur šu-du pi abū.
>- bear D2\two-NMLZ three-APPL D2\1SG chase
>- Six bears chased me.

>- Tatorhu þā:mhur šu pi abū.
>- bear two:y.dimension three D2\1SG chase
>- A two-by-three phalanx of bears chased me.

>- Mpšu þā:mhur šā:dntur þu pi abū.
>- bird two:y.dimension three:z.dimension four D2\1SG chase
>- A two-by-three-by-four phalanx of birds chased me.

>- Tatorhu þā:tmdo:wzur pi abū.
>- bear two:enough:per.time.dimension D2\1SG chase
>- The number of bears chasing me were increasing too quickly.

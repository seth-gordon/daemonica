### Digits and their combination

Daemonica uses a mixed-radix number system. A number is
represented as a series of conjoined numeric morphemes. In a
number with more than one numeral, the first is
limited to the range from zero to four, and the
value of the second numeral is multiplied by five. In a number
with more than two numerals, the second is limited to
the range from zero to five, the value of the
third is multiplied by thirty, the value of the fourth
syllable is multiplied by nine hundred (thirty-squared), and so
on.

See **LINK TK** for a complete list of the numeric
morphemes.

>- Tatorhu šu.
>- bear three
>- There are three bears.

>- *Tatorhu fu.
>- bear ???
>- ???

>- Tatorhu ažorfu.
>- bear one:zero:six
>- There are one hundred and eighty-one bears.

>- Tatorhu þusr.
>- bear four:five
>- There are twenty-nine bears.

>- Tatorhu šaržorðū.
>- bear zero:zero:two
>- There are sixty bears.

>- Tatorhu hažodŋtu.
>- bear one:three:twenty
>- There are six hundred and sixteen bears.

>- Tatorhu šaržoržoržorhu.
>- bear zero:zero:zero:zero:one
>- There are 27,000 bears.

**TODO** come up with non-numeric meanings for the numerals for 6–29,
and for the pseudo-digits
(the whole point of the mixed radix system was that when these morphemes
don’t follow a numeric morpheme, they can be used to mean something non-numeric)

### Derived forms

An unmarked number is a cardinal number, and is valence-1.

As with any valence-1 word, the suffix _pū_ reduces it to
valence-0.

>- hu-pū
>- one-NMLZ
>- one

With the suffix creating a valence-2 word, a number is converted
to a unit of measure. Certain valence-0 words are understood to
have special meanings when used as units of measure, but any
predicate can be placed in this position.

>- Pu ŋtir hu-du.
>- 1SG D2\nose one-APPL
>- I am first.

>- Tatorhu ū artrhir ahu-du.
>- bear PROX D2\rock one:one-APPL
>- This bear weighs 280 kilograms.

>- Tu taterhi šu-du.
>- 1SG D2\bear three-APPL
>- You are worth three bears.

The diminutive prefix _sā_ divides its numeric argument by
thirty; the “opposite of” prefix _fnha_ negates; while the
augmentative prefix dntā, ironically,
creates a reciprocal.

>- Tatorhu ū sā-žaržu.
>- bear this DIM-zero:three
>- This is half a bear.

>- Tatorhu ū fnha-ðu.
>- bear this ANTI-two
>- These are minus-two bears.

>- Tatorhu ū dntā-ðū.
>- bear this MAX-two
>- This is half a bear.

>- Tatorhu ū dntā-žur.
>- bear this MAX-zero
>- These are too goddamn many bears.

### Numeric prefixes and suffixes

The numeric morphemes _šur, hu, þū, šu_ can also appear as
prefixes or suffixes (with appropriate morphophonemic
modification). As suffixes, they denote their exact value. As
prefixes, they denote, respectively, negation, singular, plural,
and the associative plural (“X and company”). Recall that
prefixes are applied to a stem before suffixes.

>- Šar-tatorhu-hu pi abū.
>- NEG-bear-one D2\1SG chase
>- One non-bear chased me.

>- A-tatorhu-žar pi abū.
>- one-bear-NEG D2\1SG chase
>- Something other than a single bear chased me.

>- Tatorhu ša-pi abū.
>- bear D2\ASSOC-1SG chase
>- A bear chased me and my family.

>- Tatorhu pi ša-habū.
>- bear D2\1SG ASSOC-chase
>- A bear chased me, and did other things related to chasing.

### Pseudo-digits

Certain morphemes function as \textit{pseudo-digits}: they must
follow at least one actual digit, and they either qualify the
number they are attached to (by changing its dimensionality, or
by converting it from a point into a range), or they express an
informal quantity.

A digit that may be used as a suffix may also be followed by a
pseudo-digit, as another suffix.

>- Tatorhu tatŋði šaržorðō-tndu gu.
>- bear D2\fish D2\zero:zero:two-more.than DNMLZ
>- A bear has over sixty fish.

>- Tatorhu tatŋði-hi-tsmdi gu.
>- bear D2\fish-one-enough DNMLZ
>- A bear has enough fish.

>- Tatorhu tatŋði-ðī-tsmdi gu.
>- bear D2\fish-two-enough DNMLZ
>- A bear has too much fish.

### Arithmetic

**TODO** this needs to be reworked

When the object of a valence-2 number, its “unit of measure,”
is a numeric predicate, such as a valence-0 number, the two
values are either added or multiplied, depending on their
dimensions. The pseudo-digits _mhur_ and _dntur_
change the dimension of a number, allowing for the expression of
multiplication in the arithmetic sense, or for describing the
extent of objects in two and three dimensions.

>- Tatorhu þī-pī šu-du pi abū.
>- bear D2\two-NMLZ three-APPL D2\1SG chase
>- Five bears chased me.

>- Tatorhu ðī-mhir-pī šu-du pi abū.
>- bear D2\two-xy.rotate-NMLZ three-APPL D2\1SG
  chase
>- A two-by-three phalanx of bears chased me.

>- Mpšu ðī-mhir-pī šü-dnter-pē þi-di gu pi abū.
>- bird D2\two-xy.rotate-NMLZ
  D3\three-xz.rotate-NMLZ D2\four-APPL DNMLZ
  D2\1SG chase
>- A two-by-three-by-four phalanx of birds chased me.

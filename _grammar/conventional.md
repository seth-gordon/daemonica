The rules for manipulating the stack comprise
almost all of Daemonica’s grammar. Most other expressions that
require special grammatical forms in other languages are
accomplished lexically in Daemonica.

### Suffixes

#### Quantification; proper nouns; honorifics

Daemonica words are unmarked as to number: plain _tatorhu_ can
mean either “bear” or “bears.” When the number is salient and
cannot be inferred from context, suffixes may be used.

Suffixes are also used to mark proper nouns. If the word _tatorhu_
appears twice in an utterance, each instance may refer to different
bears; to refer twice to the same bear, it must be put on the stack
and then copied. But every occurrence of _tatorhu-žū_ may be presumed
to refer to the same person, whose name is Bear.

|                  |                              |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| _tatorhu-žu_     | no bears                     |
| _tatorhu-puy_    | a little bit of a bear       |
| _tatorhu-du_     | part of a bear               |
| _tatorhu-vu_     | one bear                     |
| _tatorhu-bu_     | two bears                    |
| _tatorhu-žū_     | Bear                         |
| _tatorhu-žūžū_   | Mr./Ms./Mx. Bear (honorific) |
| _tatorhu-žūðržū_ | Dr./Rev./Prof. Bear          |
| _tatorhu-tu_     | a few bears                  |
| _tatorhu-ku_     | bears                        |
| _tatorhu-kuku_   | a bear and their family      |
| _tatorhu-kugŋku_ | a sleuth of bears            |
| _tatorhu-þtu_    | all bears; every bear        |

Suffixes may be applied to words of every valence, and the
suffixes for quantification are no exception.

>- Tatorhu þduy-du þi-vu fābur-vu.
>- bear black-part D2\1.EXCL-SG chase-DU
>- A partially black bear chased me, twice.

#### Deixis, demonstratives, and determinacy

The suffixes _-pū, -bur, -fuy_ can be used as demonstratives.

>- Tatorhu-pū þi fābur.
>- bear-PROX D2\1.EXCL chase
>- This bear chased me.

>- Tatorhu-bur þi fābur.
>- bear-MED D2\1.EXCL chase
>- That bear chased me.

>- Tatorhu-vuy þi fābur.
>- bear-DIST D2\1.EXCL chase
>- Yonder bear chased me. (or: A certain bear chased me.)

As an alternative to stack manipulation,
_-pū_ can refer to a predicate in the
stack, and _-bur_ can refer to a predicate that has been
consumed and popped off the stack. These are the closest things
Daemonica has to determiners. They are used this way only in
casual speech, or when the alternative would be extremely awkward.

>- Tatorhu þi fābur taterhi-bir dðiy bm.
>- bear D2\1.EXCL chase D2\bear-MED D2\young AND
>- A bear chased me; the bear was young. 

#### Aspect/location markers

Daemonica words are not inflected for tense, but there are suffixes
to mark aspect.

|              |                        |
|--------------|------------------------|
| _fābur-žur_  | is about to chase      |
| _fābur-kū_   | start chasing          |
| _fābur-pur_  | is chasing (imperfect) |
| _fābur-bū_   | finish chasing         |
| _fābur-vū_   | chased (perfective)    |
| _fābur-pfur_ | after chasing          |
| _fābur-kuy_  | always chases          |

These aspect suffixes can also mark parts of an object or locations
relative to it.

|                |                      |
|----------------|----------------------|
| _tatorhu-žur_  | the back of a bear   |
| _tatorhu-kū_   | the bottom of a bear |
| _tatorhu-pur_  | inside a bear        |
| _tatorhu-bū_   | the top of a bear    |
| _tatorhu-vū_   | near a bear          |
| _tatorhu-pfur_ | the front of a bear  |
| _tatorhu-kuy_  | all bears, always    |

Note that depending on context, the suffix in _tatorhu-pfur_ can be
interpreted in its spatial sense, “the front of a bear,” or its
temporal sense, “an ex-bear.”

#### Miscellaneous suffixes

The _-tþur_ suffix is used for the irrealis mood, which can also
be used for a polite command.

>- Tatorhu-tþur þi fābur.
>- bear-IRR D2\1.EXCL chase
>- Something which might be a bear is chasing me.

>- Su taterhi fābur-tþur.
>- 2 D2\bear chase-IRR
>- You could chase the bear.

Other suffixes indicate the shape of an object, the evidentiality of
a predicate, and whether a word should be taken to refer to something
organic or to an artifact.

>- Tatorhu þi fābur-gū.
>- bear D2\1.EXCL chase-toroidal
>- A bear chased me around and around in a circle.

>- Tatorhu si fābur-dū.
>- bear D2\2 chase-witness
>- I personally saw a bear chase you.

>- Tatorhu þi fābur-džū.
>- bear D2\1.EXCL chase-artifact
>- A bear chased me in a car.

### Rearranging argument structures

#### Nominalization (creating nullary words) and case-marking

We have already seen the _sba-_ prefix, which creates the infinitive,
abstract, or gerund form of a word.

>- Sba-vābur.
>- NMLZ-chase
>- There was a chase.

Given a predicate on the stack, case markers can adjoin arguments with
various semantic roles.

>- Sba-vābur þi pur taterhi fū sā-škaverhir fur škaverhir kū
>- NMLZ-chase D2\1.EXCL ABS D2\bear ERG D2\raise.LOC-wood LOC wood OBL
>- I was chased by a bear with a stick through the forest.

Multiple arguments with the same case can be “stacked” onto
a predicate; the semantics of these additional arguments depends
on the predicates and the context.

>- Tatorhu-pū dayvuy.
>- bear-PROX good
>- This is a good bear.

>- Tatorhu-pū dayvuy þi pur.
>- bear-PROX good D2\1.EXCL ABS
>- This bear is good to me.

>- Tatorhu þi fābur si fū.
>- bear D2\1.EXCL chase D2\2 ERG
>- You made a bear chase me.

>- Tatorhu þi fābur sā-škaverhir fū.
>- bear D2\1.EXCL chase D2\raise.LOC-wood ERG
>- A bear chased me out of the forest.

We see above, in the transformation of _škavorhur,_ “wood,”
to _sā-škavorhur,_ “forest,” how the _sā-_ prefix creates a
nullary word from the locative argument of its base word.
The _da_ and _ša_ prefixes do the same for the
absolutive and ergative arguments, respectively.

>- Da-vabūr.
>- raise.ABS-chase
>- Someone was chased.

>- Ša-vabūr.
>- raise.ERG-chase
>- Someone chased.

#### Creating unary words

The _ba-_ and _fa-_ prefixes create unary words whose argument is
the ergative or absolutive argument, respectively, of their base word.

>- Tatorhu ba-vabūr.
>- bear UNERG-chase
>- A bear chased.

>- Þu fa-vabūr.
>- 1.EXCL UNACC-chase
>- I was chased.

The effect of the _bva-_ prefix depends on the valence of its base.

>- Tatorhu bva-vabūr.
>- bear REFL-chase
>- A bear chased itself.

>- Tatorhu-pū bva-dayvuy.
>- bear-PROX REFL-good.
>- This bear seems good.

>- Su bva-tatorhu.
>- 2 REFL-bear.
>- You are a bear.

Two other prefixes worth noting are: _tþay-_, which derives a word referring to
a color, shape, sound, or some other sensory characteristic; and _gģa-_, which
derives a word referring to damage or illness.

>- Dažŋģu-vuy tþay-zbū.
>- fish-DIST like-running.water
>- Yonder fish are blue.

>- Dažŋģu-pū gģa-džu.
>- fish-PROX illness-heat
>- This fish is burned.

#### Creating binary words

The _gā-_ prefix creates a binary word from another word.

>- Tatorhu-pū þi gā-dayvuy.
>- bear-PROX D2\1.EXCL TR-good
>- This bear is good to me.

The _bar-,_ _bā-,_ and _pfā-_ prefixes create binary words involving
belief, desire, and causation.

>- Þu taterhi-pī bar-dayvuy.
>- 1.EXCL D2\bear-PROX belief-good
>- I think this is a good bear.

>- Þu taterhi-pī bā-dayvuy.
>- 1.EXCL D2\bear-PROX desire-good
>- I want this to be a good bear.

>- Su taterhi þe fābir pfā-škavorhur.
>- 2 D2\bear D3\1.EXCL D2\chase cause-wood
>- You used a stick to make a bear chase me.

### Miscellaneous particles

#### Stack operations

Various particles, some of which we have seen already, manipulate the stack.

|       |                        |
|-------|------------------------|
| _tn_  | copy top item          |
| _sm_  | copy 2nd-from-top item |
| _þn_  | copy 3rd-from-top item |
| _fu_  | swap top two items     |
| _psu_ | move 3rd item to top   |
| _kŋ_  | drop top item          |

#### Negation; questions; absolutes

>- Tatorhu þi fābur bu.
>- bear D2\1.EXCL chase NEG
>- A bear did not chase me.

>- Tatorhu bu þi fābur.
>- bear NEG D2\1.EXCL chase
>- Something other than a bear chased me.

>- Tatorhu si fābur guy?
>- bear D2\2 chase Q
>- Did a bear chase you?

>- Tatorhu guy si fābur?
>- bear Q D2\2 chase
>- Did a _bear_ chase you?

>- Tatorhu šku fābur pu?
>- bear D2\what chase WH.Q
>- Who did the bear chase?

>- Þtu þi fābur.
>- everything D2\1.EXCL chase
>- Everyone chased me.

>- Šu þi fābur.
>- nothing D2\1.EXCL chase
>- Nobody chased me.

#### Pronouns and possessives

>- Tatorhu tī fābur.
>- bear D2\1.INCL chase
>- A bear chased us (you and me).

>- Su taterhi fm.
>- 2 D2\bear has.a
>- You have a bear.

>- Sa-tatorhu þi fābur.
>- 2SG.POSS-bear D2\1.EXCL chase
>- Your bear chased me.

>- Þa-tatorhu si fābur.
>- 1SG.POSS-bear D2\2 chase
>- My bear chased you.

>- Tā-tatorhu ba-vābur.
>- 1PL.POSS-bear UNERG-chase
>- Our bear chased.

Note that Daemonica has no third-person pronouns:
the stack, and, in a pinch, demonstratives, serve
the same purpose.

### Tense

Tense is generally inferred from context and, if context is
insufficient, from mood and aspect. There are 
words that can attach tense information to a predicate, but they
are usually ambiguous as to whether they refer to a time or a
place.

>- Tatorhu þi fābur tur.
>- bear D2\1.EXCL chase here.now
>- A bear chased me here, _or_ a bear is chasing me right now.

The metaphorical arrow of time, in Daemonica, corresponds
to the acceleration of the frame of reference: “the future” is “down.”

>- Tatorhu þi fābur tir arbu.
>- bear D2\1.EXCL chase D2\here.now before
>- A bear previously chased me, _or_  
 A bear chased me somewhere above here.

>- Tatorhu þi fābur tir arždorpfu.
>- bear D2\1.EXCL chase D2\here.now upstream
>- A bear chased me somewhere upstream from here, _or_  
 A bear chasing me might be the cause of our current situation.

### Non-specific placeholder words

Sometimes, one is more interested in communicating the meaning of an affix
than in anything the affix might be attached to. For that purpose, these
base words can be helpful:

>- Tþū-pū þi fābur.
>- arbitrary.0-PROX D2\1.EXCL chase
>- _This_ chased me.

>- Tþū-kugŋku þi fābur.
>- arbitrary.0-collective D2\1.EXCL chase
>- A herd of _things_ chased me.

>- Tatorhu tšuy-bur þi fābur.
>- bear arbitrary.1-MED D2\1.EXCL chase
>- _That kind of_ bear chased me.

>- Tatorhu þi gžū-vuy.
>- bear D2\1.EXCL arbitrary.2-DIST
>- A bear _did yonder thing_ to me.

>- Tþū tšuy tþī gžū.
>- arbitrary.0 arbitrary.1 D2\arbitrary.0 arbitrary.2
>- Some kind of thing did something to someone.

_Tþū tšuy tþī gžū_ is a Daemonica catchphrase which might
be translated, more idiomatically, as “Stuff’s going on.” It may
be said in a casual, anticipatory, or dejected tone of voice,
depending on the nature of that “stuff.”

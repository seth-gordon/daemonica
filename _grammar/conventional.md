The rules described above for manipulating the stack comprise
almost all of Daemonica’s grammar. Most other expressions that
require special grammatical forms in other languages are
accomplished lexically in Daemonica.

### Deixis, demonstratives, and determinacy

The valence-1 words _ū, ur, ahu_ are the proximal, medial,
and distal demonstratives. In highly casual speech, _ur_, or
_urkur_, its the valence-0 form, can be
used to refer to a predicate that used to be on the stack; this is
the closest Daemonica comes to having a third-person pronoun or
a specific determiner.

>- Tatorhu ahu pi abū.
>- bear DIST D2\1SG chase
>- Yonder bear is chasing me.

>- Ū-kur azu
>- PROX-NMLZ big
>- This is big.

>- Tatorhu pi abū; ir-kir dntši dzu.
>- bear D2\1SG chase D2\MED-NMLZ big and
>- A bear chased me; it was young.

>- Tatorhu pi abū; taterhi ir dntši dzu.
>- bear D2\1SG chase D2\bear D2\MED
  D2\young and
>- A bear chased me; the bear was young.

### Case

**TODO** Since the topmost stack position is used for the
analogs of both the subject of an intransitive verb and the
object of a transitive verb, Daemonica behaves like a language
with ergative-absolutive alignment: the top predicate is in absolutive
case and the second-from-top is in ergative case. The glosses and markers
should reflect this.

The suffixes _pū_ and _putur_ reduce a valence-1 and
valence-2 word, respectively, to valence-0. The valence-2 word
_gu_, which we first saw in **LINK TK**,
treats the top predicate on the stack as if it were a valence-1
word and applies it to the next predicate down.

>- Pu dntši-pī gu.
>- 1SG D2\young-NMLZ DNMLZ
>- I am young.

>- Pu abi-bnhur gu.
>- 1SG D2\chase-NMLZ.2 DNMLZ
>- I chase.

>- Pu taterhi te abī gu.
>- 1SG D2\bear D3\1SG D2\chase DNMLZ
>- I am the cause of you being chased by a bear.

The word _smdur_, used above,
may be thought of as the reverse of
_gu_; the top predicate of the stack is treated as a
subject, to be attached to the next item.

>- Dntšu-du pi smdur.
>- young-NMLZ D2\1SG SBJ
>- I am young.

>- Abu-putur pi smdur.
>- chase-NMLZ.2 D2\1SG SBJ
>- I chase.

>- Tatorhu ti abū pi smdur.
>- bear D2\1SG chase D2\1SG SBJ
>- I am the cause of you being chased by a bear.

When the second argument of _smdur_ or the first argument
of _gu_ is a thing, rather than an action, it creates a
genitive.

>- Tatorhu ū pi smdur.
>- bear PROX D2\1SG SBJ
>- I own this bear.

>- Tatorhu tatēhi gu pi abu.
>- bear D2\arm NMLZ D2\1SG chase
>- A bear’s arm chases me.

Other valence-2 words may be used to attach additional arguments
to a predicate. They play a role similar to prepositions or case
markers in a more conventional language.

>- Abu-putur pi smdur taterhi adu pfir sdu tatsir dahu.
>- chase-NMLZ.2 D2\1SG SBJ D2\bear
  OBJ D2\water OBL D2\wood INS
>- I chased a bear into the water with a stick.

>- Tatorhu tatsir ī dahu.
>- bear D2\wood D2\PROX INS
>- This stick is a tool for bears.

>- Tatorhu tatsir ī adu.
>- bear D2\wood D2\PROX OBJ
>- A bear did something to this stick.

>- Tatsur ū taterhi adu.
>- wood PROX D2\bear OBJ
>- This stick did something to a bear.

>- Tatorhu tatsir ī sdu.
>- bear D2\wood D2\PROX OBL
>- A bear has some kind of indirect relationship with this stick.


### Aspect and shape

The same suffix, depending on the sort of word it is attached to,
can either denote the shape of an object or be equivalent to the
aspect or modal marker on a verb. The “shape” referred to may be
relative to space, or to time; context is required to determine
which.

>- Tatorhu pi abū-zū.
>- bear D2\1SG chase-IPFV
>- A bear used to be chasing me.

>- Tatorhu tatsir-zī bahur.
>- bear D2\wood-IPFV LOC
>- A bear is on a piece of plywood.

>- Tatorhu mhu-zū.
>- bear black-IPFV
>- A bear is black in some places.

>- Tatorhu pi abū-hnžu.
>- bear D2\1SG chase-PRF
>- A bear chased me.

>- Tatorhu tatsir-hnžu bahur.
>- bear D2\wood-PRF LOC
>- A bear is on a log.

>- Tatorhu mhu-hnžu.
>- bear black-PRF
>- A bear is black all over.

### Mood

The suffix _hur_ is used for the irrealis mood, while the
suffix _hrvur_ is used for the modal of necessity. Both
may be used as commands; the former is the more polite form.

>- Tatorhu-hur pi abū.
>- bear-IRR D2\1SG chase
>- Something, which might have been a bear, chased me.

>- Tatorhu-hrvur pi abū.
>- bear-IMP D2\1SG chase
>- Something, which must have been a bear, chased me.

>- Tu taterhi abū-hrvur!
>- you D2\bear chase-IMP
>- Chase the bear!

>- Tatorhu abū-tū-hur.
>- bear chase-UNACC-IRR
>- The bear could be chased.

### Tense

Tense is generally inferred from context and, if context is
insufficient, from mood and aspect. There are valence-1 and
valence-2
words that can attach tense information to a predicate, but they
are usually ambiguous as to whether they refer to a time or a
place.

The metaphorical arrow of time, in Daemonica, corresponds
to the acceleration of the frame of reference. Thus, in the
simplest case, “the future” is “down.” But if one is accelerating
along a horizontal path—driving a car, for example—then “the
future” can also be the direction of that acceleration. For
someone moving along a circular path, such as a rider on a carousel
or a planet revolving around a star, “the future” is toward the
center of revolution. Taking this metaphor a step further, when
speaking of
mechanical parts, people, or bureaucratic offices arranged in
some system of control, “the future” is towards higher authority:
the engine, CEO, or Central Committee is the axis around which
all the lesser components revolve, literally or figuratively.

>- Tatorhu pi abū whur.
>- bear D2\1SG chase yesterday
>- A bear chased me yesterday, _or_  
 A bear chased me in a
  place we are accelerating away from.

>- Tatorhu pi abū, ti tütŋði abī, dngzu.
>- bear D2\1SG chase D2\1SG D3\fish chase
  after **TODO rephrase with stack operators?**
>- A bear chased me after you chased the fish, _or_  
   A bear chased me below where you chased the fish.

>- Pi taterhi sdur.
>- bear D2\1SG before
>- I am above a bear, _or_  
   I am ruled by a bear.

The words _dngzū_ and _āhnbzū_, in a spatial
context, indicate relative changes in position, rather than
someone’s position relative to a vector of acceleration. In a
temporal context, these words describe how events or objects
affect one another, regardless of their relative positions in time.

>- Tatorhu pi dngzū.
>- bear D2\1SG approach
>- A bear is gaining on me.

>- Tartsū pi āhnbzū-hnžu.
>- boss D2\1SG recede-PRF
>- I have been demoted.

>- Tatorhu ti abū pi āhnbzū.
>- bear D2\1SG chase 1SG recede
>- You being chased by a bear does not matter much to me.

### Logic

Logical connectives are valence-2 words.

>- Tatorhu tatsir-vī drbur ahu.
>- bear D2\wood-TEL random.or DIST
>- That over there is either a bear or a tree.

>- Artur taterhi tütŋðe darhir dahoždu-hur.
>- 1PL.INCL D2\bear D3\fish D2\choice.or
  see-IRR
>- We could go see either bears or fish.

>- Tatorhu pi tütŋðe dzi ardu.
>- bear D2\1SG D3\fish D2\and eat
>- A bear is eating me and some fish.

>- Pu taterhi ahnbzu tatēhi smbu.
>- 1SG D2\bear flee D2\arm cost
>- I escaped the bear, but it bit my arm off.

The words _drbur_ and _darhur_ both mean “or,” but
with different connotations. If a condemned prisoner is to be
shot _or_ hanged at dawn, according to the warden’s
discretion, then from the warden’s point of view, “or” is
translated as _darhur_, but from the prisoner’s point of
view, it is translated _drbur_.

The word _smbu_ is a special kind of “and,” indicating
that one thing is gained _and_ another thing is lost.

### Phatic expressions

Even phatic expressions must conform to the stack-based
grammatical structure.

The valence-0 word _artū_ is the conventional Daemonica
greeting. It may be
decorated with additional predicates to show the speaker’s
respect for the audience, or simply dropped to begin whatever
actually needs to be said.

A speaker can use the valence-1 word _sprdū_ to explicitly
yield their turn.

>- Artū, mdar-tatorhu pi abū, sprdū.
>- hello DROP-bear 1SG chase yield
>- Hi, a bear chased me. What’s new with you?

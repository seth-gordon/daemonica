[^1]:
    Biblical Hebrew _Šinʿār_ = Babylonian _Šumêr_ =
    “the country of two rivers.”

[^2]:
    At this point in the
    narrative, the four stack items are:
    (1) all the people, who came from the east, settled in the valley of Shinar;
    (2) all the people, who came from the east;
    (3) the valley of Shinar; (4) the tense marker for the
    remote past.

[^3]:
    The geocentric cosmology of the Bible does not translate
    well into Daemonica.

[^4]:
    The combination of _-hur,_ the irrealis mood suffix, with
    _darhur_, the “or” of choice, has the same effect as the Hebrew
    _pen_ or the English “lest”: “we should do X, _or_ Y may happen.”

[^5]:
    The One God has entered the stack, and, like the human race,
    gets copied on the stack instead of re-mentioned
    explicitly.

[^6]: As the people are scattered, the stack is unwound.

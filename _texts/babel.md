title: Tower of Babel
order: 2

This is a translation of Genesis 11:1–8 into Daemonica and then into English.
Differences in word order make it hard to translate long sentences line-by-line:
in the English, when a word is marked with an asterisk, it has been transposed
from a later Daemonica line for the sake of clarity.

[^1]:
    Biblical Hebrew _Šinʿār_ = Babylonian _Šumêr_ =
    “the country of two rivers.”

[^2]:
    The geocentric cosmology of the Bible does not translate
    well into Daemonica.

[^3]:
    The combination of _-hur,_ the irrealis mood suffix, with
    _darhur_, the “or” of choice, has the same effect as the Hebrew
    _pen_ or the English “lest”: “we should do X, _or_ Y may happen.”

[^4]:
    God (The One Eternal Thing) has entered the stack, and, like the human race,
    gets copied on the stack instead of being re-mentioned
    explicitly.

[^5]:
    At this point in the narrative, the six items on the stack are:
    ① all the people;
    ② the city and tower that had been built;
    ③ God;
    ④ God, again;
    ⑤ all the people, again;
    ⑥ the tense marker for the remote past.
    The following word, the _kū_ case marker, indicates that the people have an
    oblique or instrumental relationship with these buildings. (Since the word
    _āpu_ expresses a relationship between a constructed object _and its parts,_
    an oblique argument must be used to indicate who constructed the object.)

[^6]: The Hebrew verb here, _yiš'mʿû,_ means “listen” as well as “understand.”

[^7]:
    As the people are scattered, the stack is unwound. The final _pur_ indicates that
    everything between it and the first word, the normalized tense marker _sbavaku,_ should be
    treated as the absolute argument of that word: i.e., we have come to the conclusion
    of a story from the mythic past.

[^1]:
    This is an example of “lingering” (a technique that Daemonica borrowed
    from Fith, as long as it was already borrowing the whole idea of a stack-based
    conlang). _Dðatþur-þtu,_ “all people,” is placed on the stack at the
    beginning, copied twice throughout this paragraph, and only
    absorbed at the very end. By leaving the stack part-full throughout a
    long utterance,
    the speaker holds the audience’s attention, and the item that lingers
    on the stack functions as a topic.

[^2]:
    More literally: “all their relationships with each other should resemble
    the way someone treats a close friend.”

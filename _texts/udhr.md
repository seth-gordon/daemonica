[^1]:
    This is an example of “lingering” (a technique that Daemonica borrowed
    from Fith, as long as it was already borrowing the whole idea of a stack-based
    conlang). _Ahnturšuģu,_ “all people,” is placed on the stack at the
    beginning, copied four times throughout this paragraph, and only
    absorbed at the very end. By leaving the stack part-full throughout a
    long utterance,
    the speaker holds the audience’s attention, and the item that lingers
    on the stack functions much like a topic.

[^2]:
    _Adūr,_ “[E] comes from [A]” →
    _adūr-pū,_ “[A] comes from somewhere” →
    _adūr-pū-kūr,_ “arrival”

[^3]: _Gu_ here is used as a genitive: equal dignity and rights is what everyone has.

[^4]: This is the metaphorical conscience, the “moral center.”
